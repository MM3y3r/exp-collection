## Elevator Pitch

There are many web developers and engineers out there. How many of them are well represented on the world wide web? Maybe some, but definitely not all of them. Many of us simply don't have the time next to work, life and other things to build our own web site. This is how i got this idea of developing a foundation for other developers to build upon. Everyone is welcome to check out my work and make it their own.
