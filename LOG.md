I evaluated Redux and Jumpstate in order to manage my unique user ids within my URL. After grueling hours of trying to get it to work with Angular, i gave it up and ended up introducing a simple regex coupled with some templating and the angular router. It feels a bit hacky but should work fine for a project of this scope.
