Maximilian.Meyer@campus.lmu.de

This document lists the requirements of the "Experience Collection" web app, developed in the PWP course at LMU, winter term 2017/18. It serves as a reference for required features, so that the app can be validated against it during and at the end of the semester – and possibly also afterwards.

## Product overview

The Experience collection is a web app that allows anyone to create their own personal website. They can share their experiences and projects with others, especially visitors of the site.

Other developers can use this project as a template for their personal site. They can set their name, personal information and other information to be displayed on the page.

The "Experience Collection" fills a niche, that has been present for quite some time : Everyone wants their own personal website, but few developers have the time to set it up correctly.
